The following goes through some basic methods and procedures for opening/starting a new <a href="#project">project</a> in ET_Redux.


1. Open ET_Redux - note that this will generate two html files, ChangeLog.html and Credits.html
2. To start, click "Project" in the top left corner.
3. Then click "New Project" from Raw Data.
4. Click "LA-ICP-MS".  Note that IDTIMS raw data is currently processed by our software [Tripoli](http://cirdles.org/projects/tripoli/).
5. Now you will see the Project Manager interface where you specify your project. Start by entering your Project Name and then choosing the appropriate:
  * File Handling Protocol
  * Raw Data Template
  * Analysis Purpose
6. Finally, click "Prepare to load/Process Raw Data." Then, depending on your file handling protocol you will be able to select your data file or data folder and then click "Open" to show the parameters manager. If you use folders, be sure that all necessary files are present.
7. Confirm that all parameters are correct - the defaults are shown initially.
8. Full Uncertainty propagation is the default - use the fast option to explore datasets only.
9. Select your Primary Reference Material.  Note the default is set in the Lab Settings Manager.
10. Now you are ready to start the reduction process. You can either start a live session while the mass spectrometer is producing data or proceed to reduce an already-collected dataset as explained below.
