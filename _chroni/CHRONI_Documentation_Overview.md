CHRONI is a mobile application that presents archived data downloaded from the Geochron database in a customizable format for use by geologists in the field. The purpose of CHRONI is to allow people to archive data, while collecting data in the field. With CHRONI, users do not need to remain stationary. Currently, the CHRONI application only works with Android devices, but an IOS application is in development. The project is led and maintained by CIRDLES, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. The documentation below is essentially a set of step by step instructions on how to operate the software. For auditory and visual learners, youtube video tutorials will be included among the written instructions, so there will be a video demonstration of CHRONI operations from an android phone ( or tablet).
