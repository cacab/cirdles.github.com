*The current documentation applies to Chroni version 1.0.1*

Currently, CHRONI only supports Android devices. Due to the current layout sizes, the application works best on tablets.

<b>Installation and Beyond</b>

1. Install our most recent CHRONI APK from our [Releases](https://github.com/CIRDLES/CHRONI/releases).
	* Note: if using a computer to download the APK, simply send the file to your device via email.
	* Select the application from the dropdown menu on your device and hit install.
2. In a location where your device receives internet connection, open the CHRONI application.
	* Internet connection is needed to initialize the application because the default Report Settings file must be fetched from [cirdles.org](https://cirdles.org).
3. Congratulations! Your CHRONI application is officially setup! Now, you can utilize the following features:
	* Open - View your aliquot in a custom format as specified by your current Report Settings file
	* History - Review your last ten aliquot files with the click of a button!
	* Profile - Specify your Geochron Portal account information in order to retrieve private aliquot files.
